#### **TODO: \[Stanford algo \& C++]**

1. Code effectively in C++, apply 20/80 rule -> Use Bro Code 6 hour C++ video and code along the way
2. Do one advanced project in C++ -> \[Algo, CE, CS Theoretical] -> Focus hard here such that professors have to hire you
3. Complete Coursera
4. 













#### **Overall Project I am planning to build + Writing Paper:**

Project: AlgoLab



A modern C++ benchmarking, profiling, and visualization toolkit for algorithms and data structures. You will implement algorithms the way top CP + systems engineers do, then prove performance with reproducible benchmarks.



Core Modules

1\) Graph Algorithms



BFS, DFS (iterative + recursive), Topo sort, SCC (Kosaraju or Tarjan)



Dijkstra (binary heap + radix heap variant), Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall



A\* (pluggable heuristics), Bidirectional BFS / Dijkstra



MST (Kruskal + Prim), DSU with path compression + union by size



Max-flow (Dinic), Min-cut; optional Min-cost Max-flow



2\) Data Structures



Segment tree (lazy propagation, iterative segtree), Fenwick (BIT)



Sparse table (RMQ), Mo’s algorithm framework (offline queries)



Ordered statistics tree alternative (Fenwick compression + BIT tricks)



LRU cache demo (hash + list) to show real “systems” patterns



3\) String Algorithms



KMP, Z-algorithm, rolling hash (double hash), prefix function utilities



Suffix array (O n log n) + LCP (Kasai), suffix automaton (optional but huge)



Trie, Aho-Corasick (multi-pattern matching)



4\) Geometry and Math



Convex hull, line intersection basics



Modular arithmetic utilities, fast exponentiation, NTT or FFT (optional “boss level”)



Benchmarking and Evaluation Harness



Generate inputs by size scaling and distribution (random, worst-case, adversarial)



Compare implementations (example: Dijkstra heap vs radix; segtree recursive vs iterative)



Track:



runtime (ns, ms), throughput



memory (peak allocations + bytes)



constant factors + asymptotic trends



Export results to CSV/JSON and render plots (simple Python script, or ASCII charts inside CLI)



Performance Engineering and “Real C++” Skills



This is where the project becomes “insanely valuable”.



Modern C++ and Clean Architecture



C++20/23 features used correctly: concepts, ranges, constexpr, span, string\_view



Generic programming: templates, iterators, policies (comparator, allocator, heuristic)



Strong API design: header-only core + compiled benchmark runner



Instrumentation



RAII timers, scoped log spans, structured logging (JSON logs)



Profiling hooks: compile flags for perf/VTune, flamegraph notes, compiler explorer checks



Memory and Speed Mastery



Custom allocator / arena allocator for heavy nodes (graphs, tries)



Move semantics deep usage, small-buffer optimizations where relevant



Smart pointers only when needed, otherwise value semantics + clear ownership



Cache-friendly layouts (struct of arrays vs array of structs experiments)



Concurrency (crucial)



Run benchmark suites in parallel using std::jthread / thread pool



Lock-free or minimal-lock result collection (atomic counters, concurrent queues)



Show you understand contention, false sharing, and batching



Tooling (crucial)



CMake preset profiles (Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo, Sanitizers)



Unit tests (Catch2 or GoogleTest), property tests for DS correctness



Static analysis: clang-tidy, clang-format, cppcheck



Sanitizers: ASan, UBSan, TSan; fuzz tests for parsers / random stress tests



CLI Product Features (Portfolio-Ready)



algolab run dijkstra --graph input.txt --impl heap --bench --repeat 50



algolab gen graph --n 1e5 --m 3e5 --type scale-free



algolab compare dijkstra heap radix --sizes 1e3..1e6



algolab validate segtree --random-tests 1e5



“Problem mode”: load a CP problem format, solve, and benchmark solution versions



Documentation and Presentation (How you’ll look elite)



Every module has:



complexity summary



invariants and correctness notes



micro-optimizations you tried and what actually mattered



A clean README with:



screenshots of CLI output



benchmark plots



“lessons learned” section (the Stanford algorithms theory → measured results)



Why this pairs perfectly with Stanford Algorithms



For each Stanford topic, you implement it in AlgoLab, then do:



correctness tests



complexity reasoning



benchmark evidence

That makes you strong in both “paper understanding” and “engineering execution”.

===

If you want a harder version: make AlgoLab a library + CLI + CI benchmark dashboard (GitHub Actions runs benchmarks on every PR and tracks regressions).

###### **Writing Paper ->**

Yes — this can absolutely be turned into a paper, and not a “student project paper”, but a solid systems + algorithms paper if you frame it correctly. The key is not to sell it as “I implemented algorithms”, but as an empirical study of algorithmic performance under realistic constraints.



Below is exactly how you do it, step by step.



1\. Pick the Right Paper Type (Critical)



Your work fits empirical systems research, not theory.



Best fits:



Empirical evaluation paper



Benchmarking / measurement study



Algorithm engineering paper



You are answering:



“How do classical algorithms actually behave on modern hardware under realistic workloads?”



That is publishable.



2\. Narrow the Scope (Do NOT include everything)



This is where most people fail.



❌ Bad: “We benchmark 15 algorithms.”

✅ Good: One focused axis of comparison.



Examples of publishable scopes:



Dijkstra variants under different graph structures and memory layouts



Segment tree implementations: recursive vs iterative vs cache-optimized



Effect of allocator choice on graph algorithms



Algorithm asymptotics vs real constant factors



Impact of data distributions on theoretical guarantees



Rule: 3–5 algorithms, 1–2 dimensions of comparison.



3\. Form a Research Question (This makes it a paper)



You need one sharp question.



Examples:



How do memory allocation strategies affect graph algorithm throughput?



When does radix heap outperform binary heap in Dijkstra in practice?



Do asymptotically superior algorithms win on real hardware?



How does cache locality dominate algorithmic complexity beyond n ≈ 10⁵?



Your AlgoLab becomes the experimental apparatus.



4\. Paper Structure (Use This Template Exactly)

Abstract



Problem: mismatch between theory and practice



Method: controlled benchmarking framework



Result: measurable performance differences



Contribution: actionable insights



1\. Introduction



Algorithms are taught abstractly



Modern systems introduce cache, allocators, branch prediction



Need systematic empirical evaluation



2\. Related Work



Algorithm engineering literature



Existing benchmarks (often outdated or narrow)



Gap: lack of controlled, reproducible studies



3\. Experimental Framework (AlgoLab)



This is where your project shines.



Design goals



Benchmark harness



Input generators



Measurement methodology



Reproducibility guarantees



4\. Algorithms Studied



Precise implementations



Variants



Complexity expectations



5\. Experimental Results



Plots: runtime vs n



Memory usage vs n



Cache-sensitive behavior



Cross-over points



6\. Analysis



Why results differ from theory



Hardware effects



Practical recommendations



7\. Threats to Validity



Hardware dependency



Compiler optimizations



Dataset bias



8\. Conclusion



What practitioners should actually use



Open questions



5\. What Makes YOUR Paper Strong



Most student papers fail here — you won’t.



You have:



A custom benchmark engine (rare)



Reproducible measurements



Multiple implementations per algorithm



Real performance engineering, not toy code



Modern C++ systems rigor



This moves you from “CS student” to algorithm engineer.



6\. Where This Can Be Published



Realistic venues (student-first-author friendly):



ACM Student Research Competition



ICPC workshops



SEA (Symposium on Experimental Algorithms)



WAE (Workshop on Algorithm Engineering)



arXiv (still very valuable)



Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS) for AlgoLab itself



7\. Timeline (Very Important)



You can do this in 8–10 weeks alongside Stanford Algorithms.



Week 1–2: pick scope + research question



Week 3–4: implement + validate



Week 5–6: benchmark + analyze



Week 7: plots + discussion



Week 8: writing + polish



8\. What This Does for Your Career



This paper:



Makes you competitive for research assistant roles



Makes your GitHub “research-grade”



Signals to PhD / MSc committees that you do real CS



Separates you from 99 percent of Coursera learners



9\. Brutally Honest Advice



Do not try to impress with breadth.

Impress with precision, rigor, and insight.



If you want, next I can:



Help you pick the exact research question



Draft a paper outline tailored to one algorithm



Turn one AlgoLab module into a full paper skeleton



Help you choose the best venue for submission



Just tell me which algorithm you want to center the paper around.
